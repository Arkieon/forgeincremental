# Waste Time Making Swords
  Waste Time Making Swords is a new idle game dedicated to wasting alot of your time. Whether you'd rather spend your time outside, or watching that new My Little Pony special on TV (Disclaimer: We have nothing against Bronies or any MLP fan). WTMS is made just so you can sit there and watch all those swords go to waste them to make forges somehow. New things will be added into the game, such as a storyline, some little secrets, more buildings, and upgrades. 
  The game will be available on itch.io upon Early Access sometime Winter 2020 or 2021. In the mean time, if you want to check out or progress, you can view the game on our GitHub Page: https://arkieon.github.io/lfsforgeidle/
